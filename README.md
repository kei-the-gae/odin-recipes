# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - Recipe project

This is my first project following The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. So far I've not learned a lot so far, but my primary focus with this project is to improve the skills I do have.
## Back end setup
On the back end I've set up a coding environment in VS Code, learned how to manipulate files via the Mac OSX terminal, and have finished a basic overview on how to use Git and GitHub. All of these things I've dabbled in, to some degree. This is not my first coding experience, and I've used VS Code a little before. While specifically using the Mac OSX terminal is quite new, I've been using Windows Command Prompt/Powershell off and on for many years and have been dabbling in Arch Linux, which has forced me to learn a few shell commands on its own. I've used this opportunity to almost exclusively manipulate files via command line. I've been introduced to Git and GitHub a few times, but do not have much experience in actual commits. My experience more aligns with cloning GitHub repos for app installation until now. There was also a separate lesson on GitHub commit messages and what is considered standard etiquette. This standard is new to me and will be something I focus on on this project.
### Here are the commands I've learned to use more regularly:
- Navigate directories with the `cd` command
- Make new directories with the `mkdir` command
- Create new files using the `touch` command
- Open files using the `open` command
- Open files to VS Code using its proprietary `code` command
- Move or rename files using the `mv` command (a self taught command when asked to move an image to project files and rename it)
- Clone a GitHub repo using the `git clone` command
- How to get the status of new or modified files in a local GitHub repo using `git status` during various stages of the commit process
- Add changes to a future commit using `git add`
- Commit changes to GitHub using `git commit`, including how to add commit messages inline using the `-m` comment or by using a text editor (TOP suggested setting up Git to automatically open the file in VS Code)
- How to view the log of changes using `git log`
- Upload changes to GitHub using `git push`
## The front end, AKA the actual code
On the front end, so far nothing is new to me. The Odin Project's Foundations course, after teaching the setup and what to expect with its curriculum, proceeded into teaching basic HTML. I learned some very basic HTML during a middle school STEM class, and have dabbled in web development within the last year.
### HTML topics covered:
- Learning about elements and tags and how they work
- How to write an HTML boilerplate
- How to work with text
- How to work with lists
- How to work with links and images


For this project I'm hoping to solidify my use of file manipulation via command line, learn to commit properly to GitHub and get a refresher on my HTML skills.
