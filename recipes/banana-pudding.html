        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A southern delicacy, banana pudding is an refreshing treat in the sweltering hot summers. You don't want anything warm or too heavy on the stomach in the middle of a brutal southern summer. But sometimes you just need a sweet treat, and there's no ice cream in sight due to the risk of melting. Or you're looking for something a little more on the "<em>healthy</em>" side. Hey, its got fruit in it!</p>
        <p>Banana pudding is an easy dump and go pudding recipe, no fancy appliances or tools required. It's easily finished within 30 minutes, though it's definitely suggested to let it chill in the fridge for at least an hour or two before serving. Warm pudding isn't good pudding! You can also get fancy with layering the pudding ingredients if you're serving for an event.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Approx. 3 cups cold milk (however much your pudding calls for in its instructions)</li>
                <li>1 (5 ounce) package instant pudding mix, vanilla or banana</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetended condensed milk</li>

                <li>1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
